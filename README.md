# Two_Ways_Circular_Linked_list
The project implemented in C involved creating and manipulating circular doubly linked lists.
A circular doubly linked list is a data structure where each element in the list contains
references to both the next and previous elements, forming a loop.

The main objective of the project was to implement basic operations on these lists, such as inserting elements at the head or tail,
deleting elements, searching for a specific element, and manipulating the references between elements to maintain the circular structure.

To accomplish this, I started by defining a data structure to represent the nodes of the list,
which included pointers to the next and previous elements, as well as the data they store.
Then, I implemented the different operations using these data structures,
ensuring that the references were properly updated during insertions and deletions.

I also considered edge cases such as handling an empty list, manipulating the ends of the circular list,
and properly freeing memory when deleting elements.

In summary, the project implemented in C involved creating and manipulating circular doubly linked lists.
I implemented basic operations such as insertion, deletion,
and element search while maintaining the circular structure using appropriate references.
This project helped strengthen my understanding of data structures and pointer manipulations in the C programming language.
